This is pseudocode for the week 6 exercise in which you are coding up the Metropolis
algorithm to sample from Normal distributions.

Here's the pseudcode for the Metropolos algorithm.
We assume we pass it the following parameters:
"Mean": the mean of the normal distribution from which we wish to sample
"SD": the std. dev. of the normal distribution from which we wish to sample
"EndPt": We will start the algorithm at a point chosen uniformly at ranom in the range  [-EndPt, +EndPt] 
"NumberOfIts": We will run the Metrop algorithm for NumberOfIts iterations

```{r Metrop}
MHNormal <- function(Mean,SD,EndPt,NumberOfIts){ 
  NormalXs <- rep(-9,NumberOfIts)  # this vector will store the x-values we generate generate during the course of the algorithm

	# you need to start somewhere: sample a uniform random number, x, between +EndPt and -EndPt
	# ADD CODE TO DO THAT HERE
  x <- runif(1,-EndPt, EndPt)
	
	# then...
	for (i in 1:NumberOfIts){    # each iteration performs one step of the Metropolis process
		# propose a new x-value (xprime) by adding a Unif(-0.5,0.5) (say) random variable to the current value
	  # ADD CODE TO DO THAT HERE
	  
	  xprime <- runif(1, -0.5, 0.5) + x
	  
		# decide whether to move to the new value - 
	  # Calculate Metropolis term (the ratio of the likelihoods of the two points, i.e., H <- f(x')/f(x))
		H <- min(1,dnorm(xprime,Mean,SD)/dnorm(x,Mean,SD))
		p <- runif(1,0,1) # generate a random number and then decide whether or not to move to the new value
		if (p<H){ 
			x <- xprime      # move to x'
		} # we dont need an else, since we just keep the existing x in that case
		# save the current value of x to the vector NormalXs
		
		NormalXs[i] <- x
	
		# every now and again, plot a histogram of the accepted values
		if (i%%10000==0){ # this will plot one every 100 iterations (i%%100 means the remainder when i is divided by 100)
			hist(NormalXs[0:i]) 	
		  Sys.sleep(0.25)  # slow it down a bit so that it has time to show each plot
		}
	}
	return (NormalXs)  # returns the vector of x-values
}
```

Once you have it working, you can call it as follows:
```{r test}
set.seed(4970)   # any number will do here
MyMH <- MHNormal(0,1,5,5e5)
```
